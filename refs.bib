             theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a
             large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in
             theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can
             be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative
             alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to
             use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence

A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape {(GAMLSS).} The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the {GAMLSS} can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A {Newton‚ÄìRaphson} or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the {GAMLSS} class of models.},

	abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used LOESS-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the LOESS fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike LOESS, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter Œ¥15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-S√∏, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience},

It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-{PLUS} to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-{PLUS} and a course in modern statistical methods. S-{PLUS} is available for both Windows and {UNIX} workstations, and both versions are covered in {depth.The} aim of the book is to show how to use S-{PLUS} as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-{PLUS} and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where {appropriate.This} third edition is intended for users of S-{PLUS} 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-{PLUS} 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-{PLUS.} The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S {language.The} authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-{PLUS;} these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and {UNIX.} There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-{PLUS} as they are {introduced.Dr.} Venables is now Statistician with {CSRIO} in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-{PLUS} in Australia, Europe, and the {USA} Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks},

  abstract  = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth.The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate.This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language.The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-PLUS as they are introduced.Dr. Venables is now Statistician with CSRIO in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-PLUS in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks.},

             large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in
             theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can
             be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative
             alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to

  abstract = {Summary. A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton‚ÄìRaphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

  abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used LOESS-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the LOESS fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike LOESS, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter Œ¥15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-S√∏, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

	abstract = {Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.},

Using this methodology, which exploits time-variation in the cross-section of short interest, we document that the amount of capital devoted to value and momentum strategies has grown significantly since the late 1980s. We provide evidence that this increase in capital has resulted in lower strategy returns. However, consistent with theories of limited arbitrage, we show that strategy-level capital flows are influenced by past strategy returns and strategy return volatility and that arbitrage capital is most limited during times when strategies perform best. This suggests that the growth of arbitrage capital may not completely eliminate returns to these strategies.},

  journal  = {Jmp},
  year     = {2016},
  number   = {May},
  abstract = {Using data on asset pricing anomalies, I test the idea that the act of arbitrage itself generates endogenous risk. Theoretically, I embed a set of mispriced anomaly assets in a model where arbitrageurs have limited capital. The act of arbitrage makes anomaly as-sets endogenously risky by causing their prices to comove with shocks to arbitrage capital. Crucially, this endogenous risk is larger for assets that were initially more mispriced since they attract correspondingly more arbitrage capital. Thus, arbitrage turns assets with high initial " alphas " into assets with high endogenous " betas. " Empirically, I study 34 anomaly assets from 1972 to 2015, splitting the sample into the period before 1993, when there was little arbitrage activity, and after. The data matches the model's key cross-sectional pre-dictions: (i) an anomaly's initial profitability‚Äîits pre-93 return‚Äîpredicts its subsequent endogenous risk‚Äîits post-93 beta with respect to arbitrage capital; (ii) this beta is ex-plained by the amount of arbitrage capital devoted to the anomaly; (iii) this beta explains the anomaly's expected return that survives in equilibrium.},

Our estimates reveal whether anomaly returns arise from variation in the underlying firms' cash flows or their discount rates. For each of five well known anomalies, we find that cash flow shocks explain more variation in anomaly returns than discount rate shocks. The cash flow and discount rate components of each anomaly's returns are negatively correlated. Most correlations between anomaly and market return components are small. Our evidence is inconsistent with theories of time-varying risk aversion and theories of common shocks to investor sentiment. It is most consistent with theories in which investors overextrapolate firm specific cash flow news and those in which firm risk increases following negative cash flow news.},

  abstract = {Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior.  They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model.    The evidence in this paper shows that the size effect, the value effect, the weekend effect, and the dividend yield effect seem to have weakened or disappeared after the papers that highlighted them were published.  At about the same time, practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the strategies implied by some of these academic papers.    The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who focus on small-capitalization firms.    All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real.  The notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who  implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the market to become more efficient).},

We also find that it is important to distinguish liquidity timing from liquidity reaction, which primarily relies on public information.

  abstract = {We propose a novel measure of the amount of arbitrage activity in the momentum strat- egy to test whether arbitrageurs can have a destabilizing effect in the stock market. Our measure, which we dub comomentum, aims to capture the extent to which momentum trades by arbitrageurs become crowded. Specifically, we define comomentum as the high-frequency abnormal return correlation among stocks that a typical momentum strategy would speculate on. We show that during periods of low comomentum, momentum strategies are profitable and stabilizing, reflecting an underreaction phenomenon that arbitrageurs correct. In con- trast, during periods of high comomentum, these strategies become unprofitable and tend to crash, reflecting prior overreaction due to the momentum crowd pushing prices away from fundamentals. Moreover, both firm-level and international versions of comomentum forecast returns in a manner consistent with our interpretation.},

The evidence related to the cross-sectional variation, the time-series variation, and the persistence of the pairs trading profits, and the determinants of return correlations is consistent with the delay in information diffusion as the driver for the pairs trading strategy. Evidence from the liquidity factor and the recent financial crisis suggests that the short-term liquidity provision is not the main cause of the pairs trading strategy.},

  abstract = {Across a variety of asset classes, we show that relative returns are highly predic-table in the time-series in and out of sample, much more so than aggregate returns. Dominant principal components of equity anomalies, a portfolio of Treasuries sorted by maturity, and a currency carry portfolio are more predictable than the index return in their respective asset classes. We show that the common practice of predicting each individual asset separately obscures predictability of relative returns and is often equi-valent to predicting only the index. Our approach to predictability uncovers multiple statistically robust and economically relevant sources of discount-rate variation.},

It finds that introducing a buy/hold spread, which allows investors to continue to hold stocks that they would not actively trade into, is the single most effective simple cost mitigation strategy. Most of the anomalies that we consider with one-sided monthly turnover lower than 50{\%} continue to generate statistically significant net spreads, at least when designed to mitigate transaction costs. Few of the strategies with higher turnover do. In all cases transaction costs reduce the strategies' profitability and its associated statistical significance, increasing concerns related to data snooping.},

  abstract      = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein‚àíprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Historically, low-beta stocks deliver high average returns and low risk relative to highbeta stocks, offering a potentially profitable investment opportunity for professional money managers to ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù away. We argue that beta-arbitrage activity instead generates booms and busts in the strategy's abnormal trading profits. In times of relatively little activity, the beta-arbitrage strategy exhibits delayed correction, taking up to three years for abnormal returns to be realized. In stark contrast, in times of relatively-high activity, short-run abnormal returns are much larger and then revert in the long run for the stocks in question. Importantly, we document a novel positivefeedback channel operating through firm-level leverage that facilitates these boom and bust cycles. Namely, when arbitrage activity is relatively high and beta-arbitrage stocks are relatively more levered, the cross-sectional spread in betas widens, resulting in stocks remaining in beta-arbitrage positions significantly longer with short-run abnormal returns more than tripling in value. Our findings are exclusively in stocks with relatively low limits to arbitrage (large, liquid stocks with low idiosyncratic risk), consistent with excessive arbitrage activity destabilizing prices.},

We first identify, categorize, and replicate 100 long-short anomalies in the cross-section of expected equity returns. We then comprehensively study their interaction with popular proxies for time-varying market-level sentiment and arbitrage conditions. We find a powerful (relatively weak) role of the variation in proxies for sentiment (arbitrage constraints). In this context, the predictive power of sentiment is mostly restricted to the short leg of strategy returns. Our insights collectively suggest that the dynamics of sentiment combined with the base level (and not primarily the variations) of limits to arbitrage provide at least a partial explanation for inefficiencies.},
